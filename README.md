# Personal neovim config

This is my personal neovim config using package manager Lazy vim. It has all my keymaps, all my plugins that i am currently using.

## instalation

If you wanna try this config out you can just clone this repo inside
```bash
# required
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}

# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}

# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak} 
```
```bash
cd ~/.config
```

```bash
mkdir nvim
```


```bash
git clone https://github.com/Popoch39/own_neovim_config nvim
```
Then you can just launch neovim and it will setup for itself: 

```bash
nvim
```
